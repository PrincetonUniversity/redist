about: Describe a bug you've seen or make a case for a new feature

Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. 

Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). 
If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.
If you can't reproduce the issue with one of the built-in datasets like `fl25` or `iowa`, please describe in detail your dataset and how it's different. 
Posting a picture of the map along with basic summary statistics---number of precincts, number of districts, number of counties, etc.---will be useful.

Brief description of the problem

```r
# insert reprex here
```
