# redist: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods for Redistricting Simulation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kosukeimai/redist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kosukeimai/redist) [![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version-last-release/redist)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=redist) ![CRAN downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/redist)

R package for simulating redistricting plans via Markov chain Monte
Carlo by Ben Fifield ([bfifield@princeton.edu](bfifield@princeton.edu)),
Alex Tarr ([atarr@princeton.edu](atarr@princeton.edu)), Michael
Higgins ([mjh5@princeton.edu](mjh5@princeton.edu)), and Kosuke Imai
([Imai@Harvard.Edu](Imai@Harvard.Edu)). Maintainer is Ben Fifield.

## Installation Instructions
The package is available on CRAN and can be installed using:

```
install.packages("redist")
```

Users can also install the most stable development release of the `redist` package using the `install_github()` function in the `devtools` package.

```
library(devtools)
install_github("redistricting/redist")
```

## src Folder
We hope the following guide will be of help to users who want to take a look at the original
`redist` source code:
- `sw_mh_alg.cpp`: Contains the `swMH()` function, which conducts
Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of redistricting plans.
- `sw_mh_helper.cpp`: A series of functions to aid in simulating
  redistricting plans.
- `make_swaps_helper.cpp`: A series of functions to propose and make
swaps of geographic units in the primary redistricting algorithm.
- `constraint_calc_helper.cpp`: Functions to calculate the strength of
certain implemented constraints such as population and compactness
requirements.
- `rsg.cpp`: An implementation of the random seed-and-grow algorithm
described in detail in Chen and Rodden (2013).
- `check_contiguity.cpp`: A contiguity check for the implementation of
the Chen and Rodden (2013) algorithm in `rsg.cpp`.
- `redist_analysis.cpp`: Functions to aid in analysis of simulated
redistricting plans.
- `enumerate.cpp`: Functions called by `enumerate.R` that allow users
to fully enumerate all valid, contiguous redistricting plans for a
given set of geographic units.  
  
# TODO
- Flip sign for cold temperatures (currently fed in as negative values, should be positive to fit with paper)
- Feed in `betaweights` as a numeric argument with an exponential sequence
- Add `summary` function that calculates acceptance probability, the function call with parameters, and the distribution of `beta` values for tempering
- Make `q` and `lambda` dynamic - for example, check acceptance probability every 50 iterations. If too high, increase `lambda` or decrease `q`
