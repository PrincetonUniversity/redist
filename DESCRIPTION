Description: Enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-specified 
    target distribution using Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
    algorithms.  The package allows for the implementation of various constraints in 
    the redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity
    requirements. Tools for analysis such as computation of various summary statistics 
    and plotting functionality are also included. The package implements methods 
    described in Fifield, Higgins, Imai and Tarr (2020) <doi: 10.1080/10618600.2020.1739532>,
    and McCartan and Imai (2020) <https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/SMCredist.pdf>.
